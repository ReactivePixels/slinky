### Why do we need Slinky
In short - Slinky takes the hard work out of managing your NPM link dependencies.

As a JavaScript developer it is not uncommon to manage and develop multiple interconnected modules. To assist with 
local development of these modules/packages many of us will use the [NPM 'link'](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) command.
